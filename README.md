## Doldrums Protocol

Doldrums is a protocol for issuing a Delta-Neutral Stablecoin. It integrates with various features like native Zero Gas transactions at Viction, supports a wider range of assets, and solves the problem of liquidity fragmentation.

### Main Features

- **Delta-Neutral Hedging**: Maintains a delta-neutral position by hedging the underlying asset on perpetual DEX.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Uses Layer Zero(OFT V2) as a multi-chain framework, supports Viction Chain and Arbitrum.
- **Gasless VRC-25**: DUSD implements VRC-25 to support gasless transactions.
